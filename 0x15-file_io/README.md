This code base was developped in the course of practicing file I/O operations in c.

0-read_textfile.c : reads a given size of text from a file to the screen.
1-create_file.c : create file, or overwrite existing one with a given text.
2-append_text_to_file.c : append given text to an existing file.
3-cp.c : copies content from one file to another.
