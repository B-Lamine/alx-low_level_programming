First steps in C programming.
Scripts that operate on c-files.

0-preprocessor : preprocess only a source code and save output to file c.
1-compiler : stops after compilation, and saves fie with the same initial name but with extension ".o".
2-assembler : generates and assembly code from source file in $CFILE, without linking.
3-name : compile and link source file in Â$CFILE and name executable cisfun.
4.puts.c : code in c to print string with puts() function.
5-printf.c : print a sentence using pritf() function.
6-size.c : print sizes of different types of variables.
100-intel : generates assembly code (intel syntax) of a c source file.
101-quote.c :  prints string to  standard error.
