First steps in C programming.
Scripts that operate on c-files.

0-preprocessor : preprocess only a source code and save output to file c.
1-compiler : stops after compilation, and saves fie with the same initial name but with extension ".o".
2-assembler : generates and assembly code from source file in $CFILE, without linking.
