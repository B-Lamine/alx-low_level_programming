Here are some programs for practicing bit manipulation.

0-binary_to_uint : converts a string of binary digits into a decimal number.
1-print_binary.c : convert number to binary system.
2-get_bit.c : get bit value at a given position in the binary form of a number.
3-set_bit.c : set bit at a given position of the number to 1.
4-clear_bit.c : set bit at a given position of the given number to 0.
