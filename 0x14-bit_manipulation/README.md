The present functions were developped in the course of practicing bit manipulation.

0-binary_to_uint.c : converts binary string to a decimal number.
1-print_binary.c : convert any number to binary system and print to standard output.
2-get_bit.c: get bit value at a specific position of the bit representation of a number.
3-set_bit.c: set bit to 1 at a specific position of the binary representation of given number.
4-clear_bit.c: set bit to 0 at a specific position of the binary representation of given number.
