This contains practice code for manipulating pointers, arrays and strings in c.

0-reset_to_98.c : takes the address of an integer as input and changes the latter's value to 98.
1-swap.c : swaps two integers' values via their addresses.
2-strlen.c : counts the length of a string of characters.
3-puts.c : displays a string of characters.
4-print_rev.c : displays a string of character in reverse. 
5-rev_string.c : reverses a string of characters.
6-puts2.c : displays a string of characters while skipping a character each time.
7-puts_half.c : displays the last half of a string, excluding the middle character if string's length is odd.
8-print_array.c : lists the elements of an array.
9-strcpy.c : copies a string (including null byte '\0') to a buffer and returns buffer's address.
100-atoi.c : extracts the first occurrence of a number from a given string.
